# BlockChange
This is the Main Plugin for the **[Faister](https://twitch.tv/faisterino) BlockChange SMP**. 
</br>
## How does it work?
With joining the first time on the Server the players gets a random Block Palete. The Player is only able to craft these specific Blocks. If he breaks a Block which is not in the Block Palete the Item doesn't drop. The Block Palete resets every five Days. (customisable in Config)

## Additional Plugins
For whitelisting Players via Twitch Channel Points Reward I used my own **[TwitchWhitelist Plugin](https://github.com/Jakkoble/TwitchWhitelist)**.
